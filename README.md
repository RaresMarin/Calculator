##Features
My project includes several interactive features. There are two galleries that display mathematical information. It has a functional calculator, and if you type something into a separate input field, the text will be spoken out loud. There's also a digital clock that shows the current time. The project includes a game where you control a box and collect all the balls that appear, as well as a rock-paper-scissors game. Users can change the background color by typing a color into an input field. Additional features include a number guessing game, dice games, a translation tool, and a dark mode option for better accessibility.
